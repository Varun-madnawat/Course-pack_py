#1. Write a program to print the sum of digits of the number.
# n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# s = str(n)
# m = 0
# for i in s:
#     j = int(i)
#     m = m + j
# print(m)


#2. Write a program to find the area of a circle.
# radius = int(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
# area = 3.14 * (radius ** 2)
# print("Area of given circle with radius", radius, "is: ", area)


#3. Write a program to find the best of two test average marks out of three testâ€™s marks accepted from the user.
# a,b,c = input().split()
# a = int(a)
# b = int(b)
# c = int(c)
# l = [a,b,c]
# l.sort()
# print(('Average of two best marks is: ',l[-1]+l[-2])/2)


#4. Write a program to Multiply given Number by 4 using Bitwise Operators.
# n = int(input("Enter the number to multiply: "))
# m = n<<2
# print("When",n,"is multiplied by 4 gives: ",m)


#5 Write a program to perform Bitwise negation operation on a = 15.
#a = 15
#print(~a)
