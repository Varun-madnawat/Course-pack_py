#1. Write a Program to check whether an alphabet entered by the user is a vowel or a constant.
# n = input("Enter a Alphabet: ")
# if (n == 'a' or n == 'A' or n == 'e' or n == 'E' or n == 'i' or n == 'I' or n == 'o' or n == 'O' or n == 'u' or n == 'U'):
#     print('Given Alphabet is a vowel')
# else:
#     print("Given Alphabet is a consonent")

#2. Write a program to print the largest of the three numbers.
#a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
#b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
#c = int(input("Enter third number: "))

#if (a>b and a>c):
    #print(a, "is greatest")
#elif (a>b and c>a):
    #print(c, "is greatest")
#elif (a<b and b>c):
    #print(b, "is greatest")
#elif (a<b and b<c):
    #print(c, "is greatest")
    
    
#3. c.Write a program to check weather an entered year is leap year or not using if- elif and if- else statements.
# n = int(input("Enter the year to check: "))
# if (n % 4 == 0 and n % 100 != 0) or (n % 400 == 0):
#     print("It's a leap year")
# else:
#     print("It's not a leap year")

#4. Write a program to Accept two character and Check if they are Equal.
# n,m = input().split()
# if n == m:
#     print('Yes they are equal')
# else:
#     print('They are not equal')

# Write a program to find the factorial of a number provided by the user using an ifâ€“else conditional statement.
# n = int(input("Enter the number to find factorial: "))
# s = 1
# if (n < 0):
#     print("Factorial doesn't exist for negative numbers")
# elif (n == 0):
#     print("Factorial of 0 in 1")
# else:
#     for i in range(1,n+1):
#          s = s * i
#     print("The factorial of",n,"is:", s)
